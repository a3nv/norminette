# Norminette for CLion

![Build](https://github.com/skrtks/norminette/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

<!-- Plugin description -->
Norminette linter for CLion.

### Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
I recommend to still check your files using Norminette before handing in your project. The plugin is in early development, and some checks might not be implemented yet.

### Setup üõ†
Check if Norminette is already installed on your system (run `norminette -v`). 
If not, you can download it [here](https://github.com/42School/norminette). 

When Norminette is properly installed on your system, Norminette for CLion should automatically detect the path to the executable.
If you have done a custom installation of Norminette, or the executable is not in PATH, please go to <kbd>Settings/Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Norminette</kbd> 
and provide the path to your norminette executable.
